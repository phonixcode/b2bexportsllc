                      <h2>IT Asset Disposition</h2>
                     <p><strong>IT Asset Disposition (usually referred to as “ITAD”)</strong> is the practice of properly decommissioning and disposing the hardware and electronic devices. IT Asset Disposition and e-waste (electronic waste) recycling don’t simply mean dumping of old electronic equipment into the nearest dumpster. Rather, it means complete integration of the lifecycle of refurbishment, remarketing, redeployment, and recycling by ITAD service companies into a single service. This is ideal for companies that want to retire their IT equipment and computer assets. It is considered necessary to check out specific certifications and additional benefits provided, while looking for an ITAD service.</p>

                     <p>When Companies from all industries, including the Waste and Recycling industries, introduce new technologies and when there is not an option to remediate or recycle, then these Companies face the challenge of disposing the old IT equipments. Sometimes, the only solution left is to recycle the assets by recovering the raw materials as the assets are really finished. You can reduce the amount of waste that is generated by quickly reusing assets rather than stockpiling them, because few of your assets will become out of date.</p>

                     <p>Although disposing of outdated IT equipment looks as simple as sending it off to Goodwill or dropping it in the nearest recycling bin, but it’s not, as ITAD is critical for ensuring that your company’s data is well protected and your end-of-life equipment doesn’t end up in the wrong hands. ITAD has two main phases when it comes to decommissioning your hardware: </p>
                     <p>
              First, the equipment must be wiped and have all the asset tags removed. This ensures that your proprietary data can’t be leaked, and the electronic devices can no longer be tied back to your organization. Thereafter, the equipment must be destroyed, recycled, or donated.
              </p>
                   <h3>Approaching IT Asset Disposition Strategically-</h3>


               <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 wow fadeInRight" style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInRight;">
                          <div class="imgggggg"><img src="front/img/itt-asset-disposition3.jpg"></div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 wow fadeInRight" style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInRight;">
                          <div class="imgggggg"><img src="front/img/itt-asset-disposition4.jpg"></div>
                        </div>
                      </div>

                   <p>There are times when it makes sense to dispose the redundant hardware, although reuse is the gold standard in ITAD.  In such instances, it is important to ensure compliance with all local, state, and federal regulations which govern the disposal of electronic equipment. </p>
                   <p>
              While assessing the right partner to work with on your ITAD needs, from reuse and remarketing to responsible recycling, you should fully evaluate all the options.
              </p>

              <div class="car-service-list">
              <ul>
              <li>Ask the right questions from your prospective ITAD partner.</li>
              <li>
              Probe your provider’s knowledge about different and optimal methods to erase data from your storage media. Safe and responsible reuse should always be the first option for you to consider, and it is also the means to return the greatest value to your IT budget.</li>

              <li>Request references and examples of their previous disposal work. </li>
              <li>
              Do your research and also ask for examples of their processes in action. </li>
              <li>
              Look out for certifications from industry bodies like R2 and e-Stewards. Both of these require certified vendors to adhere to a rigorous program of compliance around recycling best practices.
              </li>

              </ul>
              </div>
              <h3>Devices that are involved in ITAD-</h3>

              <p>The electronic device is likely to be recycled through ITAD if you can plug it in or charge it. ITAD often involves common endpoint devices like laptops, cell phones, and tablets. In this case, an ITAD partner can help your business to properly wipe high volumes of endpoint devices, in order to get them recycled, donated, or redistributed to another member of your workforce.
              ITAD is also ideally suitable for bigger jobs. It can be used to wipe the sensitive information off the medical carts or decommission the data center servers. ITAD can also involve hard drive or the storage device destruction along with data center decommissioning.</p>
              <p>
              ITAD services can be customized to fit the needs of your business, whether you’re ready to upgrade mobile phones for your end users or you’re looking to move your entire data center into the cloud and want to retire to your physical servers.
